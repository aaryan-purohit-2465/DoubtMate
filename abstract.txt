In traditional classroom settings, students are quite reluctant to ask doubts due to 
shortage of time, hesitation, and lack of immediate access to teachers. Because 
of this, queries remain unaired, and gaps in understanding persist. This project 
focuses on the development of a Real-Time Classroom Doubt Solver, a teacher
independent intelligent system that will provide instantaneous answers for the 
student queries with the use of Machine Learning techniques.
The system allows students to type and submit their doubts. These are then 
processed with the help of NLP. A similarity-based ML model TFIDF with cosine 
similarity in the first version) compares the student's question with an existing 
curated knowledge base of question–answer pairs. The system picks out the most 
relevant match and responds with an apt answer in real time.
This solution encourages autonomous learning, reduces disruption in the 
classroom, and enables clarification of continuous doubts without the intervention 
of a teacher. The project will be further extended by advanced models, multi
subject support, feedback learning, and a simple user interface. In general, this 
system will provide better efficiency in learning through immediate, accurate, and 
accessible doubt resolution among students.
