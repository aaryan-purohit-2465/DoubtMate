The Real-Time Classroom Doubt Solver was developed as an intelligent,
teacher-independent system to provide instant clarification of student doubts using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques.
The system operated through a structured sequence of steps to ensure accurate and efficient doubt resolution.

Initially, a curated knowledge base consisting of predefined question–answer pairs was created and stored in the system database. 
These questions covered relevant academic topics and served as the reference dataset for answering student queries.

When a student entered a doubt through the input interface, 
the system captured the query and forwarded it to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) module. 
The query underwent preprocessing steps such as text normalization, tokenization, 
and removal of irrelevant words to convert the raw input into a machine-understandable format.

The processed query was then transformed into a numerical vector using the Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. 
Similarly, all questions in the knowledge base had been previously vectorized using the same TF-IDF model to maintain consistency.

Once vectorization was completed, cosine similarity was applied to compare the student’s query vector with all existing question vectors in the knowledge base. 
The system calculated similarity scores and identified the question with the highest similarity value, indicating the closest semantic match.

After identifying the most relevant question, the corresponding answer was retrieved from the database and displayed to the student in real time. 
This process ensured quick and accurate responses without requiring teacher intervention.

The completed system successfully reduced classroom interruptions, encouraged independent learning, and enabled students to resolve their doubts instantly. 
The modular design of the project allowed easy scalability, making it suitable for future enhancements such as multi-subject support, advanced NLP models, feedback-based learning, and improved user interfaces.
